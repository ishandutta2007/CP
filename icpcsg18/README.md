# 2018 ICPC Asia Singapore Regional

[Problems](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/2018%20ICPC%20Asia%20Singapore%20Regional) from [2018 ICPC Asia Singapore Regional](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~acmicpc/).

Problem topics (according to my solutions), and problem difficulties (according to me):

| Problem | Topics | Difficulty (1..5) |
| ------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| bitwise | Greedy | 4 |
| conveyorbelt | Max Flow, Dinic | 3 |
| freefood | Ad hoc | 1 |
| hoppers | BFS | 2 |
| largesttriangle | Convex Hull, Two Pointers | 3 |
| magicalstring | DP | 5 |
| nonprimefactors | Sieve of Eratosthenes | 1 |
| prolongedpassword | Sparse Table | 4 |
| rectangularcity | Inclusion-exclusion | 4 |
| sgcoin | Ad hoc | 1 |
| slidingblocks | Toposort, Implementation | 4 |
| wiknow | Data Structure, Segment Tree | 3 |

I think this is the easiest ICPC Regional I have ever participated in, although the scoreboard tells otherwise...
Nevertheless, the organizer successfully gave a very nice problemset, because it is:
- Good: No "weird" (rare) algorithm is needed. Everything depends on your creativity to approach the problem.
- Well-balanced: The difficulties are uniformly distributed (no difficulty spike except for magicalstring); the number of easy and hard problems are just right.
- Diverse: Covers varying topics.
