[Problems](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/2018%20ICPC%20Asia%20Singapore%20Regional) from [2018 ICPC Asia Singapore Regional](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~acmicpc/).

Problem Topics (according to my solutions):

| Problems | Topics |
| -------- | ------ |
| bitwise | Greedy |
| conveyorbelt | Max Flow, Dinic |
| freefood | Ad hoc |
| hoppers | BFS |
| largesttriangle | Convex Hull, Two Pointers |
| magicalstring | DP |
| nonprimefactors | Sieve |
| prolongedpassword | Sparse Table, Implementation |
| rectangularcity | Inclusion-exclusion |
| sgcoin | Ad hoc |
| slidingblocks | Toposort, Implementation |
| wiknow | Data Structure, Segment Tree |

I think this is the easiest ICPC Regional I have ever participated in, although the scoreboard tells otherwise...
